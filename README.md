- âš¡ Fun fact: Coding bootcamp was fun and hard work, but it left me with more questions than answers, so I decided to go back to the begining and learn C. C is fun and hard at the same time. Learning hash tables right now and having a hard time visualizing and connecting the code to the visualizations. Key:value pairs in c reminds me of JavaScript.
